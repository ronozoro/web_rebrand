3.Let or forbid users to select existing interface themes through 'Preferences'. Anyway, a theme may be changed in a few clicks

4.You may define a theme which would be default to all new users including portal users

5.themes may be added or changed only by user with the administrator rights.

6.Define the top menu colors: background, border, font, active item font and background, hover font and background
